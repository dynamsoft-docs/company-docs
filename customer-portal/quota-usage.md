## FAQ

**What is quota usage?**  
Quota usage shows how much of your license’s total allocation (devices, scans, etc.) you have used.

**Why don’t I see usage details?**  
You need to be an order contact or admin for that license. Ask your admin to add you if you require access.

**What if I’m close to reaching my quota?**  
You can [expand your quota](/customer-portal/expand-quota.md) at any time, or contact [support@dynamsoft.com](mailto:support@dynamsoft.com) for advice.
