# Renew Annual License or Maintenance

## Renew the annual license

When there are 90 days left on your annual license, you will begin to receive our renewal reminder emails. We usually send a series of annual license renewal follow-up emails (90 days before expiration, 60 days, 30 days, 14 days, 7 days, and the expiry date) to the order contacts. 

- **Method One**

    You can go to **"License - Full License"** and find the Annual license which you want to renew. By clicking "Renew Now", you will go to Check Out page.
