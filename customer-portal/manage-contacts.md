# Manage Contacts

## Company Contacts vs. Order Contacts — What’s the Difference?

**Important:**  
- **Adding someone as a company contact does *not* grant access to all license/order information.**
- **To view license details for a specific order, a user must be added as a contact to *that order* directly.**  
- Company contacts can help with account administration, but only order contacts can view and manage license details for a given order.

## How to Invite Others to Your Organization

To add a new contact to your company account:

1. Go to **Account Management > Users** in the Customer Portal.
2. Enter the new user's email address and select your company name.
3. Click **Invite**.

- The invited person will receive an email invitation.  
- Once accepted, they become a company contact (but do not have access to licenses/orders unless added as an order contact).

## How to Add Users to a Specific Order

To give a user access to license details for a specific order:

1. Go to **Order > My Orders** in the Customer Portal.
2. Find the relevant order and click **Manage Contacts** in the Operations column.
3. Add the user's email to the order’s contact list.

**Note:**  
A user must be in the contact list of that specific order to view or manage its license details.

## Managing and Removing Company Contacts

Only the **primary contact** (admin) can manage company contacts.

1. Go to **Account Management > Users** to view all users under your organization.
2. If you are the primary contact, you will see options to **Set Primary Contact** or **Delete** users.

## Admin Changes and Support

- There can only be **one primary contact (admin)** at a time.
- If your current admin is leaving, they should transfer admin rights to another user.
- If the current admin cannot do this, please contact [support@dynamsoft.com](mailto:support@dynamsoft.com) for assistance. Include the details of the current and new admin.

**Summary:**  
- Add users to your company for account management.
- Add users to *specific orders* so they can view and manage licenses for those orders.
- Only primary contacts can make admin changes.
