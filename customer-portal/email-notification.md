## Subscribe to License or Maintenance Renewal Reminders

**Only the existing users can add others to receive renewal reminder emails.**

To ensure specific users receive renewal reminders for a license/order:

1. **Invite the user to your organization**  
   - Go to **Account Management > Users** in the Customer Portal.
   - Enter the email address and select your company, then click **Invite**.
   - The invited user will receive an email and must accept the invitation.

2. **Add the user to the specific order’s contact list**  
   - Go to **Order > My Orders**.
   - Find the order, click **Manage Contacts**, and add the user’s email to the contact list.

**Only users in the contact list for that order will receive license or maintenance renewal reminder emails.**

## How to Unsubscribe from Renewal Notifications

If a user no longer wishes to receive renewal reminders for a specific order:

- They can click the **"unsubscribe from this list"** link found at the bottom of any renewal reminder or marketing email from Dynamsoft.

Or, you can remove them from the order’s contact list, which will also remove their access to view license details for that order.

**Note:**  
- Removing a user from the order contacts removes both reminder emails and license access for that order.
- For help with email preferences or contact management, contact [support@dynamsoft.com](mailto:support@dynamsoft.com).
