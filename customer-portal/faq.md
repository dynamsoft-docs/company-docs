# FAQ

## License Management

### My company has purchased a license. Why don’t I see any license info in my account?
You are likely not listed as an order contact for that license. Only users added to the **order’s contact list** can view license details.  
1. Let others on the contact list to invite you to your company account via **Account Management > Users**.

2. They also need to add you to the specific order’s contact list via **Order > My Orders > Manage Contacts**.  
Only after these steps will they see license/order details and receive relevant email notifications.

### What is the difference between company contacts and order contacts?

- **Company contacts** have access to account management and can be assigned as primary user.
- **Order contacts** are specific to each purchase/order, and only these users can view license details or receive license/renewal reminders for that order.

---

### How do I remove someone’s access to a license?

Remove their email from the order’s contact list using **Order > My Orders > Manage Contacts**.  
They will lose access to license details and stop receiving notifications for that order.

---

### I get “user@example.com is not linked to your organization and cannot be added to Contacts.” What should I do?

![Order Add Contact Error]({{site.assets}}img/customer-portal-order-contact-error.png)

This happens when the email isn’t part of your company account yet, so it can’t be added to the order’s contact list.

**Fix it in two steps:**
1. **Invite the user to your organization** via **Account Management > Users**.  
   See: [How to Invite Others to Your Organization](manage-contacts.md#how-to-invite-others-to-your-organization)
2. **Add the user to the specific order** via **Order > My Orders > Manage Contacts**.  
   See: [How to Add Users to a Specific Order](manage-contacts.md#how-to-add-users-to-a-specific-order)
