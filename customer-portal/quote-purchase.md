# Purchase by a quote

## Request a Quote

If you have not yet received a quote, you can submit a request through the [Dynamsoft Purchase Center](https://www.dynamsoft.com/Support/How-to-purchase-Dynamsoft-products.aspx).  
Complete the inquiry form, and our team will provide an official quote for your chosen products.

## Place an Order

Once you receive an official quote, you have several options to complete your purchase:

### Option 1: Pay Online in Customer Portal

You can pay directly via the [Dynamsoft Customer Portal](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/quote/list):

1. Log in to the Customer Portal.
2. Select **Quote** from the left menu to view your quote list.
3. Find your quote and click the **Convert to Order** icon in the Operations column.
